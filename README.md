## Targets

Compare the performance difference among static language including C++, Go and Rust by profiling 5-10 programs under different compiler optimization levels and input sizes.

1. key-value store. evaluate insert/update/delete/search hybrid workload throughput and latency
2. compression and decompression algorithm like zip or tar, or serialization and de-serialization algorithm
3. matrix multiplication?
4. crypto primitives like RSA encryption and decryption
5. sorting algorithm?
6. find all the prime numbers which are smaller than N
7. simple HTTP request handle throughput

## Some more sample programs
From awesome-c++:
1. standard library
2. async event, semaphore, volatile var
3. data struc: bitset, Btree, kdtree....
4. image processing. I think only c++ has this type of app? 
5. serializtion, de-. json? 
6. malloc, alloca 
7. math, physics, hpc kernels
8. primitive algorithms, map,reduce,scan,sort,
9. web
10. VM? container? (I feel it's too complicated)
