## Targets

Compare the performance difference among static language including C++, Go and Rust by profiling 5-10 programs under different compiler optimization levels and input sizes.

1. key-value store. evaluate insert/update/delete/search hybrid workload throughput and latency
2. compression and decompression algorithm like zip or tar, or serialization and de-serialization algorithm
3. matrix multiplication?
4. crypto primitives like RSA encryption and decryption
5. sorting algorithm?
6. find all the prime numbers which are smaller than N
7. simple HTTP request handle throughput
